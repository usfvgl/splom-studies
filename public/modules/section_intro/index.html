<h2 class="page-header">Visualization Tasks</h2>

<p>Thank you for your responses thus far. We will now ask you to perform low-level visualization tasks to compare two similar visualization techniques.</p>

<p>These visualization tasks are broken into two sections. Each section starts with training and practice questions, and then ask you to perform the same visualization task 6 times using different techniques and datasets. You will have the opportunity to pause between the two sections.</p>
