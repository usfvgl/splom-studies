<h2 class="page-header">Section 1 Introduction</h2>

<p>The next section will ask you to perform the following task:</p>

<p class="center"><strong>Drag the black rectangle to a region for variables <var>v</var> and <var>z</var> with the most circles.</strong></p>

<p>It is possible the variables <var>v</var> and <var>z</var> will be replaced with other variable names.</p>

<br/>

<h4>Training</h4>

<p>This task requires you to find the appropriate cell in the scatterplot matrix for those pairs of variables, and then select the region that has the most circles.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following:</p>

<p><img class="splot" src="images/sec1t01.png"/></p>

<p>The highlighted region above has very few overlapping circles and only 25 circles total. Compare that to the highlighted region below:</p>

<p><img class="splot" src="images/sec1t02.png"/></p>

<p>The region highlighted above is the same size. The region has many overlapping circles and 60 circles total.</p>

<br/>

<h4>Animation</h4>

<p>Both of the examples above are static (non-animated, non-moving) scatterplots. We can also animate the scatterplot by looping continuously through the data and redrawing the circles. This allows overlapping circles in the background to eventually be redrawn in the foreground. It is important to note that the animation does not represent changes over time to the underlying data.</p>

<p>For example, below is the same regions as before with 25 circles:</p>

<p><img class="splot" src="images/sec1t03.gif" /></p>

<p>There is a small amount of movement caused by redrawing the overlapping <strong class="class-red">red</strong> circles. Compare that to the region with 60 circles:</p>

<p><img class="splot" src="images/sec1t04.gif" /></p>

<p>Notice there is more movement because there are more overlapping circles, and we can see that there are some <strong class="class-gold">gold</strong> circles near the center that pop up occasionally that were not as visible in the static version.</p>

<br/>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<p>We will now give you an opportunity to practice this task on an entire scatterplot matrix. We will show you the number of circles within the rectangle you selected in the practice questions, but this information will not be available in the non-practice questions.</p>
