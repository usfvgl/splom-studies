<h2 class="page-header">SPLOM User Study</h2>

<p>This study will ask you several questions about the multiclass <u>s</u>catter<u>plo</u>t <u>m</u>atrix (SPLOM) visualization technique. This study is being conducted by Professors Sophie Engle and Alark Joshi with the <a href="http://vgl.cs.usfca.edu/">Visualization and Graphics Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/">University of San Francisco</a>. Please email <a href="sjengle@cs.usfca.edu">sjengle@cs.usfca.edu</a> if you have any questions or concerns regarding this study.</p>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>

<p>We also collect information regarding your background (such as age bracket, level of education, and experience with scatterplot matrices) at the start of this study. We will then ask you to perform a series of visualization tasks, and will be recording your responses and the time it takes to complete each task. We will not collect any uniquely-identifying information and your responses will be anonymous.</p>

<h3>Participation</h3>

<p>To be eligible to participate in this study, you must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>You must be 18 or older.</p></li>

	<li><p>You must have a modern browser capable of running JavaScript and displaying a 700 by 700 pixel image without scrolling.</p></li>

	<li><p>You must not have a form of color blindness that prevents you from seeing the following as five distinct colors: <strong class="class-purple">&#9609;</strong> <strong class="class-gold">&#9609;</strong> <strong class="class-blue">&#9609;</strong> <strong class="class-red">&#9609;</strong> <strong class="class-teal">&#9609;</strong></p></li>

	<li><p>You must not have or suspect you have photosensitive epilepsy. This study uses animated circles, and some flickering may occur.</p></li>
