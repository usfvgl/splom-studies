<h2 class="placeholder">Introduction</h2>

<p>
This study will ask you several questions about multiclass scatterplot matrices. This study is being conducted by Professors Sophie Engle and Alark Joshi with the Visualization and Graphics Lab at the University of San Francisco. Please email sjengle@cs.usfca.edu if you have any questions or concerns regarding this study.

<h2 class="placeholder">Data Collection</h2>

<p>
We also collect information regarding your background (such as age bracket, level of education, and experience with scatterplot matrices) at the start of this study. We will then ask you to perform a series of visualization tasks, and will be recording your responses and the time it takes to complete each task. We will not collect any uniquely-identifying information and your responses will be anonymous.
